HEALTHCARE ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATIONS

ABSTRACT::

This analysis explores key healthcare metrics using a synthetic dataset comprising demographic and clinical variables such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol, BMI, and heart disease diagnosis. Leveraging Python's data manipulation and visualization libraries, the study aims to identify trends, correlations, and risk factors associated with cardiovascular health. Through descriptive statistics, graphical representations, and exploratory data analysis, the project provides insights into the interplay between lifestyle factors and chronic health conditions. The findings can inform strategies for personalized healthcare interventions and preventive measures.

THE IMPORTANT VISUALIZATIONS IN THE PROJECT:
BLOOD PRESSURE VS AGE:

INSIGHTS:

The scatterplot shows the relationship between age and blood pressure, with data points categorized by the presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease:
Blood pressure tends to increase with age.
Individuals with heart disease (orange points) generally have higher blood pressure compared to those without heart disease (blue points).
This suggests a possible link between higher blood pressure, aging, and heart disease risk.

CHOLESTEROL VS BMI:

INSIGHTS:

This scatter plot shows the relationship between cholesterol levels and BMI, categorized by heart disease presence (1 for presence, 0 for absence). Key insights:
General Trend: As cholesterol levels increase, BMI also tends to increase.
Heart Disease: Points where heart disease is present (orange) are clustered in the higher cholesterol and BMI ranges.
No Heart Disease: Points without heart disease (blue) are more scattered and tend to occupy lower ranges of cholesterol and BMI.

HEART DISEASE DISTRIBUTION:

INSIGHTS:

This pie chart represents the distribution of heart disease within the dataset:
No Heart Disease (0): Accounts for 70% of the population, shown in blue.
Heart Disease (1): Represents 30% of the population, shown in green.

OVERALL CORRELATION HEATMAP:

INSIGHTS:

Age & Blood Pressure: Strong positive correlation.
Cholesterol & Heart Disease: Significant correlation, highlighting risk.
BMI & Heart Disease: Moderate to strong positive correlation.
Interconnections: Risk factors like blood pressure, cholesterol, and BMI are interrelated.


CONCLUSION SUMMARY:
This analysis identifies key risk factors for heart disease, such as elevated blood pressure, high cholesterol, and obesity. It emphasizes the importance of routine monitoring and lifestyle interventions to mitigate risks and promote cardiovascular health.
